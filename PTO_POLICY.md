PAID TIME OFF (PTO) AND SICK LEAVE POLICY
Paid Time Off (PTO) is an umbrella term used by ITSCO, LLC to encompass all types of paid time off that employees may be eligible for. This includes Sick Leave, Personal PTO, and Training PTO as defined below.
ITSCO tracks PTO under designated categories and does not distinguish between “vacation” and “sick leave” unless contractually specified. Employees may use available PTO in accordance with this policy and their employment classification. PTO categories may be labeled differently based on employment type (e.g., Personal PTO for salaried employees, Sick Leave for hourly or fee-for-service employees).
PTO Submission
Employees must submit all Paid Time Off (PTO) requests through the company’s Google Form titled “Employee Expenses, Time/Session, and Mileage Claim Form.”
To request PTO:
Access the Employee Expenses, Time/Session, and Mileage Claim Form.
Select “PTO Request” as the request type.
Indicate the type of PTO requested (vacation, personal day, or illness) in accordance with your employment agreement.
Enter the requested date(s) and any required details.
Submit the form for review and approval.
PTO requests are subject to approval and must comply with the terms outlined below.
PTO Categories
Sick Leave
Accrued paid time off intended for use when an employee is ill, injured, attending medical appointments, caring for an ill family member, or addressing other health-related needs.
Sick Leave is accrued by eligible hourly and fee-for-service employees based on hours worked or credits earned, as outlined below.
Personal PTO
Allotted paid time off for salaried employees, specified in individual employment agreements. Personal PTO may be used at the employee’s discretion, subject to accrual, probationary, and usage limitations outlined in this policy.
Training PTO
Paid time specifically earned for participation in approved professional development or training activities.
Training PTO accrues for both fee-for-service and salaried employees at a rate of 0.25 hours per 30 hours worked or credits earned, unless otherwise specified.
Training PTO is restricted to training-related use only and may not be used for non-training purposes.
See the “Continuing Education” section of the Employee Benefits Overview for additional details.
Tracking and Usage
PTO accrual and balances are monitored by People Operations.
Employees may view PTO balances through ADP.
When utilizing Sick Leave or Personal PTO, no explanation is required unless otherwise requested for operational or compliance reasons.
When utilizing Training PTO, employees must provide a brief description and proof of participation.
Training PTO earmarked for training may not be converted to general PTO and will remain available until used or capped.
PTO requests must be submitted to payroll@itsco.health.
ITSCO reserves the right to deny Training PTO if sufficient documentation is not provided.
