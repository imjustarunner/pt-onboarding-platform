CAREER PATHWAY OVERVIEW
ITSCO career pathways are organized into three tiers, with Tier 3 representing the highest level of clinical responsibility and advancement:
Tier 1: Clinical Support Track
Tier 2: Pre-Licensed / Unlicensed Master’s Track
Tier 3: Licensed Clinical Track
Each tier includes five levels reflecting increasing responsibility, experience, and leadership capacity within the tier’s authorized scope.
TIER 1: Clinical Support Track
Focus: Skill Building, Facilitation, and Support Services
This tier applies to Peer Support Professionals, Qualified Behavioral Health Assistants (QBHA), Bachelor’s-level providers, and other clinical support roles operating within Practice-approved programs.
Job Titles (Tier 1):
Level 1: Mental Health Facilitator I
Level 2: Mental Health Facilitator II
Level 3: Senior Facilitator

Level 5: Program Facilitator
Default Compensation – Tier 1 (Reference Rates):
Direct Service: $24.00 – $28.00 per hour (by level)
Indirect Service: $18.00 per hour (all levels)
TIER 2: Pre-Licensed / Unlicensed Master’s Track
Focus: Advanced Clinical Service Provision (Licensed or Unlicensed)
This tier applies to individuals holding a Master’s degree in a mental health–related field who are authorized to provide services under applicable supervision, credentialing, and program requirements. Licensure pursuit may or may not be required depending on role and program assignment.
Authorization to provide services is determined by credentialing status, supervision requirements, payer rules, and program approval—not solely by licensure intent.

Level 3: Advanced Associate

Optional Licensure Transition
Individuals who later obtain full licensure may be eligible for transition to Tier 3 at a level determined by the Practice. Transition is not automatic and does not guarantee promotion or compensation adjustment.
TIER 3: Licensed Clinical Track
Focus: Clinical Autonomy and Leadership
This tier applies to fully licensed clinicians providing therapeutic services within their licensed scope of practice and, at advanced levels, contributing to supervision, mentorship, and program oversight.
Job Titles (Tier 3):

Level 2: Staff Clinician II
Level 3: Senior Clinician

SERVICE FOCUS ASSIGNMENT
In addition to Job Title and Level placement, Providers, Facilitators, and Employees may be assigned one or more Service Focus designations identifying the primary programs, environments, or service types they are authorized to support.
Service Focus is used to:
Clarify scope of work and program alignment
Guide scheduling, supervision, and assignment decisions
Determine applicable service definitions and operational expectations
Service Focus does not determine compensation. Compensation is governed exclusively by Job Title, Level, and applicable compensation structure unless otherwise approved in writing.
Service Focus assignments are operational in nature and may be modified at the Practice’s discretion based on program needs, funding, performance, or organizational requirements.
Service Focus Categories
Examples of Service Focus categories include, but are not limited to:
School-Based Counseling
Office-Based Counseling
Therapy Plus Tutoring
Skill Builders Program
Social-Emotional Skill Development
Summer Skills Programming
Learning & Wellness Program
Academic Support & Tutoring
Skill Development Coordination
Clinical Supervision and Counseling
Program Leadership
Training and Precepting Support
Special Designations
Clinical Supervisor
Clinical Supervisor is a designation, not a job title. Qualified licensed staff approved to provide supervision may receive additional compensation through enhanced indirect rates, per-session pay, or stipends as defined in the Supervision Policy. Assignment may be modified or revoked based on compliance or program need.
Interns and Trainees
Interns and trainees are not part of the formal Career Pathway tiers. These placements are training-based roles governed by separate agreements, program requirements, and supervisory structures. Internship participation does not guarantee employment, tier placement, or compensation eligibility beyond what is expressly approved in writing.
Default Classification and Compensation Assignment
If an individual has not been formally assigned a Job Title and Level, default placement shall occur based on verified credentials:
Bachelor’s-level, Intern, or clinical support credentials → Tier 1, Level 1
Master’s-level (pre-licensed or unlicensed) → Tier 2, Level 1
Fully licensed clinicians → Tier 3, Level 1
Compensation under default placement is paid at the applicable Level 1 reference rates unless otherwise approved in writing.
ROLE-BASED SUPPLEMENTAL COMPENSATION RATE SCHEDULE
The Practice maintains a Role-Based Supplemental Compensation Rate Schedule for approved supplemental or excess work performed outside an individual’s primary compensation structure. Use of supplemental rates requires pre-approval and does not modify Job Title, Level, or Career Tier placement.

COMPENSATION AUTHORITY AND MODIFICATION

Employment agreements reference this Handbook as the governing source for job-title-based compensation unless otherwise stated in writing.
