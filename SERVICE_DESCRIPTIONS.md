DEFINITION OF SERVICES
For purposes of this Agreement and all related policies, a “Service” refers to an activity performed by a Provider on behalf of ITSCO that falls within the scope of authorized clinical, support, or outreach functions and is delivered in accordance with applicable laws, payer requirements, credentialing standards, and ITSCO policies and procedures.
Services are generally categorized as Direct Services, Indirect Services, or Outreach Services, as described below. Not all services are billable, and compensation is determined by the Provider’s individual contract, assigned role, and applicable policies.
DIRECT CLINICAL SERVICES (Billable When Authorized)
Direct Services are face-to-face or clinically relevant encounters provided to a client or collateral contact that meet medical necessity, documentation, and payer requirements. These services are billed using CPT or HCPCS codes when permitted and appropriately documented.
Billable CPT Codes
Code Rationale and Details
90791
This code delineates the intake appointment which involves a number of tasks associated with scheduling, clinical assessment, collection and verification of documentation, and treatment planning.
90832
Individual sessions in which their duration is 16-37 minutes will be billed as 90832.
90834
Individual sessions in which their duration is 38-52 minutes will be billed as 90834.
90837
Individual sessions in which their duration is 53 minutes or more will be billed as 90837.
90846, 90847
Each is billable when their duration is longer than 26 minutes or more. 90846 is billed as a family therapy session with the patient not present. 90847 is billed as a family or couples therapy session with the patient present.
90853
Group therapy is a therapeutic service focused on supporting individuals with mental health disorders. This approach involves structured group sessions where participants engage in therapeutic activities and discussions under the guidance of a qualified clinician. The goal is to provide a shared space for individuals to explore their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, learn from the experiences of others, and develop coping strategies.
90839
This code is utilized for emergency sessions with patients who are in high distress and under complex or life-threatening circumstances that demand immediate attention. Examples of this may include clients who display suicidal intent, disabling anxiety, or other overwhelming psychological symptoms.
+90840
This is an add-on code utilized in conjunction with the 90839 billable crisis code. Any crisis session which goes beyond 75 minutes billed as a 90839 will incur this code for each additional 30 minutes. Therefore, a session lasting 125 minutes would bill as 90839 x 1 and 90840 x 2.
+99051
This is an add-on code utilized for any sessions outside of Monday through Friday between 8-5pm.
+90785
This add-on code is called “interactive complexity” and is added to sessions which cause specific challenges impeding the Student’s ability to deliver services and administer treatment. This includes but is not limited to additional individuals in the session, additional contact necessary for outside organizations such as lawyers or schools which does not satisfy another billable code, difficult communication with discordant or emotional family members, undeveloped or impaired patience, maladaptive communication such as high anxiety, high reactivity, or repeated questions.
Direct Behavioral Health Services (HCPCS)
Code Rationale and Details
H0004
Individual counseling and therapy services provided to address problems identified in the treatment/service plan. These sessions aim to manage, reduce, or resolve the identified issues and are delivered as outlined in the treatment/service plan. Activities include one-on-one counseling and may include clinically justified phone contact when medically necessary and supported by the treatment plan.
H0031
A clinical assessment identifying factors of mental illness, functional capacity, and additional information for treatment recommendations. This includes information from collateral sources and may support updates to service needs or referrals to other levels of care.
H0032
Services involve activities to create, evaluate, or modify a member's treatment/service plan which states individualized goals, clinical interventions, and progress evaluations. Documentation should detail the service description, plan development progress, and any revisions including goal achievements.
H0023
Services involve a proactive approach to reach individuals in their environment to prevent or address Behavioral Health issues, even if they haven't consented to services or have a covered diagnosis. This includes building alliances, re-engagement efforts, preventive interventions, initiating conversations to identify needs, responding to external referrals, and outreach to at-risk individuals, often taking place off-site or by phone.
H0025
Behavioral Health Prevention Education service providing structured educational interventions before onset of disorders or to reduce risk. Often delivered as workshops, classroom-based programming, parent education, and other prevention-focused formats.
H2014
Services encompass therapeutic activities aimed at resolving barriers and enhancing social functioning crucial for community integration, such as home, peer group, and work/school settings. For children, these activities focus on early childhood skills, promoting stable attachments, and strengthening communication and emotional regulation. For adolescents and older members, the emphasis is on developing daily living skills, building personal support networks, mastering basic language skills, and training in using community services.
H2015
Services focus on providing comprehensive treatment to community-based children and adolescents to promote stability and maintain community placement. Interventions align with the approved treatment/service plan and may include symptom management, coordination of medical/social/educational supports, development of recovery/resiliency and crisis plans, and skill-building to improve functioning in family, school, and community contexts.
H2016
Services are identical to H2015 but differentiated by duration and billing structure (i.e., a longer “day” service format where applicable).
H2021
Community-Based Wrap-Around services provide individualized, non-clinical interventions to children/adolescents and their families, delivered in non-traditional settings as part of collaborative planning. These services are designed to stabilize and strengthen successful community living and may occur alongside discrete therapy services that are documented and billed separately when appropriate.
H2022
Services are identical to H2021 but differentiated by duration and billing structure (i.e., a longer “day” service format where applicable).
H2033
An intensive, home-, family-, and community-based treatment targeting factors in an adolescent’s environment that contribute to antisocial behavior, including family relations, peer relations, and school performance. Activities may include strategic/structural family interventions, behavioral parent training, and cognitive-behavioral interventions as clinically indicated.
T1017
Services include assisting members diagnosed with or being assessed for a mental health disorder to access necessary medical, social, and educational services, and providing care coordination and transition services, such as needs assessment, service plan development, referrals, monitoring, and follow-ups. Case management involves connecting the member to these services but is not the direct service delivery; it excludes transport/waiting times but includes participation in appointments for referral or monitoring purposes.
S9454
Structured classes that educate members on effective stress management techniques and provide practical tools and strategies to improve overall resilience and well-being.
97535
Self-care/home management training involving direct one-on-one instruction in essential daily living tasks (ADLs), compensatory strategies, routines, safety procedures, and skill-building to improve functional independence in the community.
Outreach Services (Non-Clinical)
OUTREACH
Students may be assigned to outreach activities which will be compensated at a flat rate per hour. These hours will be documented via the “Outreach” code in therapy notes or “Indirect” as is appropriate based on the individual’s permissions in the EHR system and the most up to date protocol for logging time as per the appropriate section. 
Indirect Services
Definition and Purpose
Indirect Services consist of non-client-facing activities that are necessary to support the delivery, authorization, documentation, or coordination of approved Direct Clinical Services. Indirect Services exist solely to enable effective, compliant Direct Service delivery and are expected to be limited in scope and duration.
This policy applies to employees whose duties are primarily direct service. Employees in approved dual-role or administrative positions may have additional indirect responsibilities as defined by their role, assignment, or contract.
Indirect Services are not billable to third-party payers and are compensated only as permitted by the individual’s contract and applicable ITSCO policies.
Authorized Indirect Services
For staff whose primary responsibility is Direct Service delivery, Indirect Services are limited to the following categories:
Required Documentation
Completion of progress notes, assessments, treatment plan updates, and corrections directly tied to services delivered
Session Preparation
Brief preparation necessary to deliver a scheduled session, including review of treatment plans or required materials
Client Coordination (Service-Critical Only)
Scheduling, confirming, or documenting attendance for sessions
Arrival/departure procedures required by the service setting
Prior Authorization and Treatment Planning
Writing, updating, or contributing to prior authorizations or treatment plans only when assigned and required
Required Supervision and Assigned Meetings
Participation in supervision, compliance meetings, or required operational meetings designated as compensable
Employees may not self-assign Indirect Service tasks.
Limitations and Expectations
Indirect Services must:
Be directly connected to authorized Direct Services
Be performed at the minimum level necessary to support service delivery
Remain within established performance standards
Indirect Services do not include general administrative work, outreach or promotional activities, unassigned program development, or tasks performed for convenience rather than necessity.
Performance Standards
Employees whose duties are primarily Direct Services are expected to maintain an Indirect-to-Direct time ratio of 25% or less, with an agency target of 10–15%, consistent with ITSCO performance standards.
Indirect time may be reviewed and cross-referenced with documentation, audit logs, contract assignments, and productivity data.
Governing Authority
Use of Indirect Services is governed by:
This Workplace Handbook
The Facilitator Coding Protocol
Individual employment or contractor agreements
Where discrepancies exist, authorization and assignment requirements prevail.
Important Clarifications
Not all services are billable.
Billability and compensation are distinct concepts.
Submission of a service does not guarantee payment.
All services must be delivered and documented in accordance with ITSCO policies, payer requirements, and applicable law.
ITSCO reserves the right to modify service definitions, coding practices, and compensation structures as operational or regulatory needs require.
