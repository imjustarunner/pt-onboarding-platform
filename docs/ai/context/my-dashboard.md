## My Dashboard (Overview)

### What this page is

“My Dashboard” is the user’s home hub for onboarding and day-to-day tasks. It typically includes:

- A header (“My Dashboard”)
- A left-side rail of sections (e.g., Checklist, Documents, Training, My Schedule, Submit, My Account)

### Common sections

- **Checklist**: Required onboarding items and completion tracking.
- **Documents**: Upload/review required documents (when applicable).
- **Training**: Assigned modules and training focus.
- **My Schedule (providers)**: Weekly schedule + availability grid (may be disabled per org).
- **Submit (providers)**: Submission hub (mileage, reimbursement, PTO, time claims, availability).
- **My Account**: Personal account settings, credentials, preferences.

### Notes / constraints

- Not all users see all sections (role + organization settings).
- Some sections only appear after onboarding completion.
