## AI Context Cards

This folder is intended to hold **small, focused knowledge snippets** (“context cards”) that can be fed into the in-app helper/agent over time.

### How to use

- Keep each file short and specific (one workflow per file).
- Prefer concrete, app-specific wording (what the user sees/clicks).
- Avoid PHI: describe concepts, not client-identifying details.

### Suggested naming

- `my-dashboard.md`
- `school-portal.md`
- `provider-availability.md`
- `glossary.md`
