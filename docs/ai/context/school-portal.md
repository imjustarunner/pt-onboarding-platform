## School Portal (Providers + School Staff)

### What this page is

The School Portal is a school-organization dashboard designed for scheduling + roster workflows while avoiding PHI exposure.

### Key areas

- **At a glance**: Summary stats (days supported, clients being seen, available slots, pending, waitlist, staff users).
- **Home cards**:
  - Providers
  - Days
  - Roster
  - Skills Groups
  - School staff
  - Docs / Links
  - Contact admin
- **Left navigation rail**: Appears after opening a section; use it to switch sections quickly.

### Role differences

- **Provider**: Often sees “My roster” (their assigned clients) and provider-focused actions.
- **School staff**: Typically has logout available; may have broader roster / staff management access depending on permissions.
