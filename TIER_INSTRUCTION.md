BENEFITS TIER FRAMEWORK:
The Practice uses a three-tier system to determine eligibility for benefits and certain forms of discretionary compensation. Tiers are based on each provider’s average direct and indirect service credits/hours, calculated over rolling payroll periods.
This framework ensures fairness, transparency, and consistency across all programs and benefit categories.
Tier Levels:
Out of Compliance (Below Tier 1)
Indicates insufficient average credits/hours to qualify for Tier 1.
Employees in this category are not eligible for Practice-funded benefits during the period in which they are out of compliance.
Employees who remain Out of Compliance for more than six (6) pay periods in a calendar year may be subject to review and corrective action, up to and including reassignment of duties, adjustment of employment classification, or termination.
New employees are in their Grace Period for the first 90 days, six pay periods, or until they reach Tier 1—whichever comes first.
Tier 1 – Entry Level
Limited Practice-funded benefits.
Employees remain eligible for reduced or minimal benefits.
6-12 direct service hours per week.
Tier 2 – Standard Level
Eligible for partial or moderate Practice-funded benefits.
13-24 direct service hours per week. 
Tier 3 – Premium Level
Eligible for the highest level of Practice-funded benefits.
25 direct service hours per week and up. 
Note: The exact benefits attached to each Tier vary by benefit category (e.g., insurance, supervision, childcare, PTO accrual). Some benefits are scaled by percentage, while others are scaled by frequency or coverage limits.
How Tiers Are Measured:
Measurement Window:
Calculations are based on a rolling bi-weekly average of direct credits (total credits for fee-for-service providers), then converted into a weekly average.
The rolling sum of direct credits (total credits for fee-for-service providers) is also tracked for reference.
Payroll Tracker Access:
Employees may view their Tier status in the Payroll Benefit Tiers tab in the shared payroll document.
Each line displays:
Current Window: Tier assignment + bi-weekly average; weekly average; rolling sum.
Example: “Tier 2 (29.0 bi-wk avg; 14.5/wk; sum 58.0)”
Previous Window: Same format for the prior period.
Status: “Grace” (if tier dropped and grace is active), “Current” (if stable or improved), or “Out of Compliance” (if below Tier 1).
If a period has no data (0.00 or blank), the cell may be blank instead of displaying “Out of Compliance.”
Grace Period:
If an employee’s Tier drops (but remains Tier 1 or higher), a one-pay-period grace period applies.
If performance recovers within the grace window, benefits remain unchanged.
If performance does not recover, benefits will be adjusted to the corresponding lower Tier.
New employees are in their Grace Period for the first 90 days, six pay periods, or until they reach Tier 1—whichever comes first. 
Grace does not apply if an employee is Out of Compliance (below Tier 1).
Application of Tiers:
All benefits, reimbursements, and discretionary compensation are tied to Tier level.
Out of Compliance = no benefits for that period.
Some benefits scale by percentage (e.g., insurance contributions, missed session pay, mileage reimbursement).
Other benefits scale by frequency or coverage (e.g., number of supervision sessions per month, number of childcare hours, PTO accrual patterns).
Each benefit’s scaling rules are described in its respective section of the Handbook.
Intern Classification:
Interns are classified separately from employees and providers for purposes of benefits eligibility. Unless expressly stated otherwise in a written agreement, interns are not eligible for Practice-sponsored benefits, reimbursements, or Tier-based compensation programs. The Benefit Tier Framework applies only to eligible employees and providers.
